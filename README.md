# Authentication-System (Description)
It is a simple signup and login system. A user can create an account to the site which will check the user if already been registered to the site. If not, then user can create account.

# Opinion
So, this was a very basic site, just demonstrate how a basic authentication system works in a dynamic website.
The code is free to use and you can collaborate with me.
Thank you for reviewing my work.
